            <p>----<br>After deploying over 10 applications with Heroku I think that I can finally make a fair assessment on the general developer / Heroku relationship.</p>
<p>After watching an excellent talk by Matz at Waza (link at the bottom) I was taken aback by how much he seemed to respect Heroku's ability to support the developer that wants to build. Heroku's use of  AWS to anyone to standup a system to run their code at no cost is an absolutely stunning accomplishment .</p>
<p>My skepticism with this idealistic view is that at the end of the day Heroku is a business that needs to make money. But they also need to keep their image and offer the "playground" to build and prototype without needing a budget.</p>
<p>During the talk Matz mentions this ability to spin up a prototype at no cost which as being something fundamentally new and exciting. Having this ability eliminates a the large risk of money puts people in a new age; one where there is no barrier of hardware costs preventing concepts to come to life.</p>
<p>Heroku as a company proves that hardware is cheap and that it is feasible to remove the hardware barrier that used to exist less than 10 years ago(someone tell me if I'm wrong, I was 13 and it was too expensive for me). For developers that like to build things from the ground up Heroku is a wonderful tool that should be utilized to its fullest for as long as you can use it for free.</p>
<p>I am not sure about the exact price model of Heroku's production ready systems are but I think that it becomes clear pretty quickly that if you are building to grow and scale Heroku may not be the best option.</p>
<p>I will use a real world example of a small sinatra app that is currently hosted on Heroku for the steep price of $0.</p>
<p>I have 1 Dyno with 512 MB of RAM that likes to shut off when it becomes inactive for a certain period of time (smart on Heroku's part for sure to keep costs down), 1 MongoHQ instance with 512 MB of storage (they call it sandbox mode so this is an expectedly low amount of storage).</p>
<p>When upgrading from the Standard (free) dyno it would cost me $34.50 to essentially double my computer power and have a cycling set of dynos that will work together as a failsafe mechanism. I have just recently started crashing dynos and am thinking that it would be nice to have a backup that is reliable without having to do any system work to setup proper restarting and recovery (no god debugging for me sounds pretty sweet).</p>
<p>For any additional storage I would be paying around $18 per GB of SSD storage hosted through MongoHQ (of course an Amazon service wrapped in an add-on pricing model). I am not sure what the going rate for a mongoDB hosted solution but that seems a bit pricey to me if you are going to do large lazy data storage like I have been enjoying. But to be fair that could easily be moved to another database since in reality it's just a minor detail.</p>
<p>When laying out the costs to double the performance of my small application it would be ~$52 a month. TBH that isn't a horrible price for no extra work scaling. I am curious what the minimal cost of this setup would be on AWS directly (I do know that if you want to run tests on postgres instances it will cost you a pretty penny at the end of the month).</p>
