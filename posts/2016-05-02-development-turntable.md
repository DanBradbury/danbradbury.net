Human nature tells us that there is a natural desire to make sense of the uncertain and create some semblance of control in our lives. This fundamental desire to create order where chaos thrives is the entire struggle of every growing company and the realization that always occurs when a company begins to grow past its infancy/adolescence.

In our ficticious company we have happy employees in every aspect of the business.
