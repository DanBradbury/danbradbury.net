title: Vimscript isn't bad. You are just dumb.
----

Today I'm here to talk about folks complaining without knowing anything. The topic for today will be vimscript / vimL.

First let me share with you some of the stupidity I've been seeing lately on the internet.

He is right that vimscript did become a mess (pre vim8) and right around the time of the `nvim` fork. At the time Bram was not working full-time on Vim and was very clear about his goals and direction for the language. Unfortunately the nvim wave was already in full-swing and it became vogue to bash vim users while claiming LUA was the future of plugin writing.

Unfortunately I think nvim folks have never taken a step back and think about what they are doing / all the things they are ignoring with the advancements in vim8 & 9.

The reason I write this is a lot of the "tech influencers" are jobbers. They write JS and vimscript scares them. These people's opinions should not be trusted + is further invalidated by their lack of knowledge and relentless desire to dunk on classic vim folks.

As someone who's written vimscript for 10+ years I'd like to think I am far more qualified to have this conversation then the tech influencer community who starts to shake when they see `a:args`.. people love dunking on variable scoping in vim but seem to forget vim9 got rid of all the headaches you faced before. Chances are these folks have never written in vimscript and are the folks who are too scared to learn new languages/
